This repository contains scripts to generate data and results in the following paper:

Prognostic importance of splicing-triggered aberrations of protein complex interfaces in cancer, under review.

**The code in the scripts folder can be used to reproduce the results of the study as follows:**
- Download the data from here:
- Name the data folder as "data"
- Place the folder "data" in the same directory as the folder "scripts"
- Go to the "scripts" folder
- Run the script "runall_analysis.sh" as sh ./runall_analysis.sh on commandline terminal
- Alternatively, the R scripts cam be run individually in the order indicated within the "runall_analysis.sh" file
- This will create a folder named "reproduction_results" inside the "data" folder with all results
